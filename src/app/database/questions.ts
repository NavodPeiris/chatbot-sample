  Keratin is the structural protein in feathers of birds. Keratin polypeptides are composed of a high proportion of cysteine amino acids.

Keratin polypeptides form fibres. The two main types of keratin in feathers are α-keratin, which consists of many α-helices, and β-keratin, which consists of many β-pleated sheets.
